# MazeSolver
Boot.dev example project. 

## ToDo
- Fix .gitignore so that __pycashe__ is not saved on push
- See if current implimentation can be refactored/simplified in any way.
    - Converge some classes into one graphics.py file?
- Implimnet A*
    - Change colour of the paths depending on the distance to the exit
- Create a menu screen with a bitton that starts the maze generator and solver
    - Add some UI to control the parameters of the maze
- Add some more tests as you go
